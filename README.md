# ASL-DataCollect
This is used to collect the American Sign Language Alphabets dataset. 
This is created using PyQt and OpenCv libraries in Python. 
This is a part of the major project for IOE Pulchowk Campus, Electronics and Communication Engineering 073.

The images folder consists of the ASL alphabets from A to Z, application icon and black background for when video feed isn't opened. 
The "ASL alphabet" folder needs to be created but the categories are created inside this folder as the data is recorded. 
The "Option>>Help" option in UI has the functions of all the buttons and how to use this application.
